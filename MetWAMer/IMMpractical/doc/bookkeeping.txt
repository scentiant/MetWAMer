This flatfile records the various routines implemented in each
  source file of the IMMpractical library, stating whether it
  is meant to be externally callable, and what routines it in
  turn calls, if any.  In short, it's a road map to the source
  files.

First, though, here's the library's change log:

Version   Notes
 0.1      First release of the IMMpractical library,
          largely incomplete but usable. Only top-down deleted
          interpolated Markov models were implemented, specifically
          with binary training and sequence classification routines.
 0.2      Updated library to optionally support the
          three-periodic nature of coding nucleic acid
          sequences.
 0.3      Moderate reorganization and extensive documentation of
          existing code base (improved code legibility), plus
          incorporation of routines for using bottom-up DIMMs and
          fixed-order Markov models.
 0.4      Incorporated chi**2 models, and made minor changes
          to the DIMM routines.
 0.5      Added 7-class model for three-periodic forward and
          reverse (shadow) strand modeling.
 0.6      Added support for model orders to range from 0 to 5,
          inclusive.  Also, the library driver program now has
          support for computing posterior probabilities of test
          sequences in addition to likelihoods.
 1.0      Implemented dynamically modulating Markov models, for
          both variance- and range-based cloud defining methods.
          Added quantile-specific functionality, based either on
          overall G+C composition of a test sequence, or on a
          sliding window.
