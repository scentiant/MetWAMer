# A more detailed example of how to use MetWAMer in genome
# annotation projects is provided in the Msexta_example directory.
# This directory provides end users with a rough sketch of how MetWAMer
# can be used to predict TISs in putative coding sequences for
# which supporting genomic DNA is available.
# In cases where such supporting data aren't at hand, MetWAMer
# can still be used: consider the LLKR, WLLKR or Bayes
# methods (see the Sparks and Brendel 2008 paper for details).
# In the tutorial leading up to this point, we have trained the
# PFCWLLKR method. Training other methods exhibits more or less
# the same gestalt, though the details differ. As mentioned in
# the package's manual page, invoking executables from
# MetWAMer/bin/ sans arguments provides extensive help listings
# to assist with learning just what those differing details are.

# 1) start with a set of open reading frames, which we define
# as spans of DNA encoding amino acids, but not stop codons.
# Ideally, these will have been maximally extended both
# upstream and downstream in a genomic context, but this is
# not necessary.
# Also, MetWAMer is agnostic w/r/t how these are developed.

# 2) extend ORFs with flanking gDNA both upstream and downstream by
# (UPSTREXTENT + CONTENTSWATHLEN) and (DOWNSTREXTENT + CONTENTSWATHLEN),
# respectively (see macro definitions in MetWAMer/include/MetWAM_utils.h).
# (The end user is responsible for preparing these and ensuring
# their correctness.)
samples_to_demo.ORFs_withFlanks.fna

# 3) predict TISs in these instances (using static-WAM-PFCWLLKR)
# (Note that I randomly sampled cases used in this tutorial
# and sorted based on predicted TIS coordinates--the monotonically
# increasing order of MetWAMer results is not relevant.)

# 4) clip 5'-UTRs from ORFs to yield coding sequences,
# adjusting genomic coordinate information to reflect any changes.
# Of course, the user can decide whether or not to accept a
# predicted TIS given additional criteria. For instance,
# the predicted TIS could be unconditionally accepted if
# occurring in the first 45 bases of the ORF or residing
# in the first 20% of the overall ORF length.
# (The end user is responsible for performing this and ensuring
# its correctness.)
